# Smart-Traffic-Management-System 🚦

## 📌 Project Description
This project simulates a Smart Traffic Management System using Graphs and Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
It finds the shortest path between intersections and dynamically updates routes based on traffic congestion.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Graph (Adjacency List)
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- Priority Queue (Min Heap)
- Path Reconstruction

## ⚙️ Features
- Shortest path calculation
- Dynamic traffic congestion handling
- Alternative route suggestion

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o traffic.exe
traffic.exe
